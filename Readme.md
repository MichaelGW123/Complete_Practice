# Introduction
This project is an oppurtunity to practice a variety of tools and practices at once.
1. C++
2. CMake
3. UDP and TCP (port assignment)
4. Doxygen
5. Jenkins/GitLab (CI)
6. Google_test (unit testing)
7. CUDA
8. GCC for Coverage reports (gcov or lcov)

Multiple executables. Main one takes image input and you can choose which alternate executable to send to. Once you send you have to recieve a new one. Other executables perform image rotation using CUDA, and displays new image which can then be sent to one of the other executables.
This one is for BitBucket.
